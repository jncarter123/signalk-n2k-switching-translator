# signalk-n2k-switching-translator
There is a standard set of PGNs for switch control, however some equipment manufacturers use the Command PGN for control. This plugin translates between the two.

i have only been able to test the Switch Control to Command translation using a Yacht Devices Switch Control and Maretron DCR100. I have not been able to test the translation from Command to Switch Control.
